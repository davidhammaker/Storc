# Storc | Character Generator

A random character generator that creates a named character to inspire your creativity.

## Purpose

This tool is intended for anyone who is struggling to come up with unique characters, with names and other qualities, for a work of literature or other creative work.

## Dependencies

Requires Python 3.6 or higher to work properly.

Requires the installation of all packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

Requires that the following environment variables be set appropriately:
* "STORC_DB" (Should be a database URI. See [here](http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.3/quickstart/).)
* "STORC_SECRET" (Should be a random hash or complex string.)
* "STORC_EMAIL_USER"\* (The email address from which the application sends emails.)
* "STORC_EMAIL_PASS"\* (The password for the email address.)
* "BTN_KEY"\*\* (The API key for Behind the Name)

\* Depending on the domain of the email address you use, you may be prevented from allowing the application to log in. This is the case with Gmail, for example, which prevents "less secure applications" from gaining access to its accounts by default. If the email provider you use is blocking "less secure applications", you will have to go into account settings to grant access.

\*\* Character names are fetched from the [Behind the Name](https://www.behindthename.com/) API. To use this API, you must first set the environment variable "BTN_KEY" to your Behind the Name API key. To obtain an API key, follow the instructions found on the Behind the Name website, [here](https://www.behindthename.com/api/). Once you have set "BTN_KEY", open `app.py`, un-comment the lines of code beneath the comment, `# The following lines have been commented out for development:`, and remove or comment out `name = 'John Doe'`.

## Usage
